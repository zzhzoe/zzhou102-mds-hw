# UBC MDS block 4 homework

A GitHub repository that serves 2 purposes:

1) a learning space to explore and practice using GitHub issues in milestones and Project boards

2) a homework organizer for UBC MDS students for their 4th block in the program

# Usage

1. Click the green "**Use this template**" repository to obtain a copy of it for yourself (do not fork it).

2. Create a remote branch named `create` (this will use GitHub Actions to create 19 issues for you in your copy of this repository).

3. Create 5 milestones, named week 1 through to week 5, and group the relevant issue to each milestone.

4. Create a project board named block 4. Put the issues in appropriate columns.
